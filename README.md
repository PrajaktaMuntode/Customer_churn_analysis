ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis with Python


ðŸš€ Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing customer churnâ€”a critical metric for businessesâ€”to understand patterns and predict customer attrition using Python. By identifying factors contributing to churn, companies can implement targeted strategies to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:

-Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand key features influencing churn.

-Feature Engineering: Create new variables to enhance model performance.

-Model Building: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn.

-Insights & Recommendations: Provide actionable insights to mitigate churn.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies:

Python Libraries:

-pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and analysis.

-matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization.

-scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

-imbalanced-learn: Techniques to handle class imbalance.

-Development Environment:

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for interactive development.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Analysis & Insights:

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized distributions of numerical features like Age, Tenure, and MonthlyCharges.

Analyzed categorical features such as Contract, PaymentMethod, and InternetService to identify patterns related to churn.

-Feature Engineering:

Created new features like TotalCharges by combining MonthlyCharges and Tenure.

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding to prepare for modeling.

-Model Development:

Implemented various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-Insights:

Identified that customers with longer tenure and higher monthly charges are less likely to churn.

Found that customers with month-to-month contracts and electronic check payment methods have higher churn rates.
